Conducted an in-depth analysis of the 2015 PISA dataset, which includes the academic performance of students in Math, Reading, and Science across different countries. The analysis aimed to uncover the influence of various factors such as gender, country, and regional differences on student performance. Using R, I performed data cleaning and transformation, handling missing values and categorizing variables for better insight. Advanced visualizations were created with ggplot2 to reveal trends, such as performance disparities between genders and regions. Aggregated data and statistical summaries helped to identify hidden patterns and relationships. The project highlights the importance of equitable representation and the impact of socio-economic and geographical factors on educational outcomes.
